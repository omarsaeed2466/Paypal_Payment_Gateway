epending on your business requirements, use one of these methods to integrate PayPal Payments Standard:

PayPal HTML buttons — Simply log in to the PayPal website to create, and optionally customize, a payment button. Then copy and paste the payment button's HTML code snippet to your website. Use this option if your HTML or web programming skills are limited and you sell only a few products on your site.

Custom integration — Use the cart upload command to create a custom shopping cart experience. Use this option if you have HTML or web programming skills, you sell a large number of products on your site, and you do not use a third-party shopping cart.
